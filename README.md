# 🚴‍♀️ Critical Mass Portugal

> **Reclaiming the streets, one pedal at a time** 🌟

Welcome to the official website for Critical Mass Portugal - a grassroots movement uniting cyclists across Portuguese cities to advocate for sustainable transportation, safer streets, and vibrant cycling communities.

**Critical Mass** is a worldwide cycling event where cyclists gather monthly to ride together through city streets, demonstrating that bicycles are a viable form of transportation and advocating for better cycling infrastructure. Born in San Francisco in 1992, the movement has spread globally, and now thrives in cities across Portugal including Porto, Lisboa, Coimbra, and more.

## 🌍 What is Critical Mass?

- 🚲 Promotes cycling as sustainable urban mobility
- 🛡️ Advocates for cyclist safety and infrastructure 
- 🤝 Builds community among cycling enthusiasts

- 🎉 Creates joyful, inclusive experiences for all skill levels

Join us on the last Friday of every month as we ride together through Portuguese cities, creating positive change one revolution at a time!
